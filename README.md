# Roboverse V2E Patch
This documentation contains the patches for Roboverse for V2E Benchmark. 

## üöÄ Getting Started
- To download Roboverse, please refer to the original [documentation](https://roboverse.wiki/metasim/#).
- Roboverse team provides basic tutorials for getting started [tutorials](https://roboverse.wiki/metasim/get_started/quick_start/0_static_scene)

## üõ†Ô∏è Get Started
### üíæ Dataset
- The dataset is available on [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/datasets/RoboVerseOrg/roboverse_data). 
- This dataset contains assets, robots, scenes and trajs. 
- Assets are sorted by the dataset they were taken from and contain object assets. For example, the assests for rlbench contains obejct wise assets for every task. Most of the assets are in [usd](https://openusd.org/release/index.html) format.
- Trajs contains robot trajectories for tasks. The trajectores are sorted by the datasets and are stored in pkl.gz format.

**Note:** The data set is hosted on huggingface and doesn't need downloading seperately. `/metasim/utils/hf_util.py` contains scripts that downloads the data on the run, if required.

### üö© Tasks
The tasks in roboverse are based on configuration files. These cfg files are contained in `/metasim/cfg/tasks`. 
Config file for every task looks something like this-

```
@configclass
class CloseBoxCfg(RLBenchTaskCfg):
    episode_length = 250
    objects = [
        ArticulationObjCfg(
            name="box_base",
            fix_base_link=True,
            usd_path="metasim/data/quick_start/assets/rlbench/close_box/box_base/usd/box_base.usd",
            urdf_path="metasim/data/quick_start/assets/rlbench/close_box/box_base/urdf/box_base_unique.urdf",
            mjcf_path="metasim/data/quick_start/assets/rlbench/close_box/box_base/mjcf/box_base_unique.mjcf",
        ),
    ]
    traj_filepath = "metasim/data/quick_start/trajs/rlbench/close_box/v2"
    checker = JointPosChecker(
        obj_name="box_base",
        joint_name="box_joint",
        mode="le",
        radian_threshold=-14 / 180 * math.pi,
    )
```
- `@configclass` is a wrapper around  dataclass. It adds some checks for removing the mutable data strucutre problem.
- `TaskCfg` In example it uses RLBenchTaskCfg. This encodes the a lot of parameters of the task, including but not limited to, task type, episode length, objects,  etc.
- `objects` define all the objects present in the scene. You need to give the file path for atleast one fo the format. 
- `traj_filepath` If replaying a trajectory, this field contains the location of pkl.gz file containing the trajectories.
- `checker` This defines the **success** condition for the task. Put the name of the usd file for the object for example for CloseFridge task, check the name of the asset of fridge object. To get the joint name, use the `/scripts/print_usd_joint_names.py`. This script provides the joint names as well as their joint limits. There are two modes, "le" and "ge" that corresponds to less than and greater than or equal to. Finally radian_threshold defines the threshold for le and ge. Note that radian_threshold is valid for both revolute and prismatic joints. There are other checkers that are present in `/metasim/cfg/checkers/checkers.py`

## üìçRoadmap
- Select 10 tasks common in rlbench and [RH20T](https://rh20t.github.io/static/RH20T_paper_compressed.pdf). 
- Document thier joint names and limits.
- Add the success checker for them.
- Verify success conditions with multiple trajectories. Some trajectores fall short of the typical success threshold.
- Verify all 10 tasks.
